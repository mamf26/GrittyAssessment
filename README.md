### Description of Features Implemented

Features consist of a web that allows the user to input a request, and recieve a response from the connected Chat GPT model. All was possible with the use of Node/Next, typescript, js. 

### Any Libraries or tools used

openai 
react
tailwind 
css
next 

### Known Issues or limitations

I realized that some limitations consisted of some AI models being limited, therefore I chose to use ChatGPT older models. 

As well, I've delt with analytics involving AI but this attempt was my first in making the connection from a backend to an API. 

Many times, error handling would be missed and realized when testing. 

### If I had more time, what would I improve

With more time, I would have definitely created tests that would help me debugg a little more efficiently. As well, the UI is not the best, but I was able to learn a lot thanks to tailwind resourecs when it came to design.
